## Single Counter: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Single Counter app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Larsluph. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and counter data) created is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Yours sincerely,  
Larsluph.
